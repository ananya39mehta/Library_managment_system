**LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

This library system is designed with clients's needs in mind, focusing on making daily 
management straightforward and efficient. Every book is tracked with detailed information —
like title, author, ISBN, copies, and location—so you always know what’s available and where. 
Borrowers are organized by categories (such as students or staff) and departments, letting 
you easily set different borrowing rules and fine rates for each group. This structure gives
you flexibility and control, while also making it simple to generate reports or adjust 
policies as your library grows.

The relationships between books, borrowers, loans, and fines are set up to automate as much 
as possible. When someone borrows or returns a book, the system updates records automatically,
tracks overdue items, and calculates any fines owed. Fine transactions are linked directly 
to loans and borrowers, so you always have a clear history of payments and outstanding 
amounts. Overall, these design choices reduce manual work, minimize errors, and keep your 
library organized and easy to manage from a single, unified system.
